This week we have taken the midterms,I didn't do great but I didn't do that bad either.One question from the midterm that im still very interested is question 16.It is from mastery skill 5 (MS5),i am intersted in this question b/c mastery skill 5 is kind of hard for me to understand.For example the question is about which contract is correct,but i coudn't solve it b/c i still find it difficult to distinguish the string,doamin and the range.This question is practitioner which is a level 3 so its advanced but not that much.Next time I have to study more and focus more in class.
