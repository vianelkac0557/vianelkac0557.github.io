During the process of doing my flag i had many questions,like why are we doing this? and how do I do this?.But in the end I started to understand what I was doing,One challenge that I had this week was being able to define several things at once,For example we had to define the WIDTH and the HEIGHT but it took me longer to understand how to do this bedcause I didn't understand the purpose of defining the width and the height.I finally now understand why we are doing this,doing this flag project is helping us learn how to make coding easir for us, for example if we dont define a number then everytime that we need to change a number we would have to change so many things but if we define something and we need to change a number then we can just change the number taht we initially defined and then every definition would be chamge dus making it easir to code.Next week I wont be in school, but if I where then I would be looking foward to to finishing my flag project or even starting anew project that envolves us to use new coding skills.
