This week we learned how to define a function, on 2018-11-13  we learned the right and wrong way to define our name.For example if i want to define my name all that i had to type is (define my-name("vianelka")) and the computer will now define my name.Another thing that we learned was the different types of data which are Number,Image,String, and Post.One thing That I struggled on wa defying a fucntion because sometimes i dont know what to type to properly define the function.
