During this month-and a half i've learned many things for example one of them being video game coordinates and how they matter when trying to write a code,We then learned about circles of evaluation and how they can be very helping when we tried to make our flags.Another thing that was very helpful to me was contracts I felt like this lesson really helped me understand coding and how specific you have to be,pair programming is also very helpful due to the fact that you have someone watching over your shoulder and correctimg your mistakes.One thing that i still don't understand very well yet is defenitions and how to define things.
