I feel comfortable in all of my classes even though I haven't made any friends.
In computer science we have been learning about contracts and how algebra,
plays an important role in CS.One struggle that i have been facing is
how to imput the data into the computer,I find this a stuggle because 
the computer can't understand what I am actually thinking.
