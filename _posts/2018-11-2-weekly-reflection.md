this week has been ok, we learned what a contract is and we also got introduced to function definitions.Even though it's been almost two months i still find it hard to create a contract or to define something.I've learned that a contract is a set of expressions that when put together will create an image,we also learned that the image is the domain of scale because the range of circle is an image.
