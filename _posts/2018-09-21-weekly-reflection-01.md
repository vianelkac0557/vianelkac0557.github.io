Your first impression of this class
My first impression of this class was "what is this",
I still find it hard to use the computers because in my old school 
we didnt use them as much.The teacher is very nice and helpful and my
classmates are friendly but still very shy.I still need help in this 
class but I think that with time I can learn to love coding.
