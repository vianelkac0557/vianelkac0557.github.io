This week I faced the challenge of presenting in class,I've always gotten nervous when I have to get in front of a class and talk to 
total strangers.I also learned about "Expressions" in computer science it's pretty fun!. Every class is fun the teachers are very nice and my
classmates are still kind of shy.
