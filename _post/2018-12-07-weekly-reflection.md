This week we have been working on a "flag collage".We have been given a flag according to our seating chart.I was given the Greek flag,My flag has 5 blue stripes and 4 white stripes,It also has a square on the top left corner with a blue cross in the middle.One question that I ahve is why does the line maesurements have to be so presice?.In addition one challege that i've been having all week is finding the exact measurement for my suare and stripes.Next time that we do a project tahts similar to this one thing that I would do differently is that,Instead of doing my desing first and then the measuremnts, I would start by doing all of my measurements first and then i would design my flag.
